### BaseConvertin

This is a tiny python project that can convert a given base 10 number to a given base. It will eventually include:
* The ability to convert from non-decimal bases to other non-decimal bases
* A fancy web ui with Flask
* Alphabetical support
* UI for selecting desired base or perhaps calculating multiple changes at once
